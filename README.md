# Happy or Not?

This is an ongoing work for emotion classifier. Currently, it is based on transfer learning, utilizing Inception V3 model and training last few layers over a set of images scrapped off from Instagram, for happy and non-happy (angry/sad/stressed) people. The images could contain one or more people. The model learns to about 80% validation accuracy, however is overfitting a bit right now.

As I said, it needs to be improved and incorporate more emotions. 

The jupyter notebook walks through each step with documentation. The model(h5) file has not been attached to git because it was 200+ MB.
